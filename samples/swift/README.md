Swift Samples
-----

This directory contains a collection of swift code samples. 

In order to run the project you'll need a valid app in Firebase and 
the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file for that project. Add the plist
to the `uidemo` folder (the one with all the class files) and the project
should build correctly.
